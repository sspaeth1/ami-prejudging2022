The figure depicts the researchers' technique that utilized bar-coded Cas9 gRNA-induced gene ablation combined with a prototype high-speed image-enabled cell sorter. While the article featured a specific research focus—targeting genes that influence RelA translocation with specific vector assemblies and under specific conditions—the authors intended for readers to appreciate that the utility and efficiency of this method can have much broader application, such as cell-subpopulation analysis, guided therapeutic decision-making, and investigative drug design. Notably, each major step of their method could have been expanded into highly-detailed descriptions in their own right. Thus, in this figure, a calculated effort was made to summarize the process into three main procedural steps, to simplify the graphical representations, and to highlight unique components that have broader relevance.",

    intended_purpose: "Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease which the incidence of in the US population is increasing. Risk factors include smoking, obesity, diabetes, and age over 45y. It occurs across all demographics, but is slightly more common in men and African Americans. Early detection is difficult as symptoms are often nonspecific and do not present until the disease is at a locally advanced or metastatic stage. Progress in the treatment of pancreatic cancer has been slow: present day survival rate is only 10%, up from 5.26% in 2000. The primary purpose of this illustration is to create a comprehensive visual record of the unique characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of pancreatic cancer and to document available therapies and their targets. The secondary purpose is to provide a visual reference for oncologists prescribing treatment and researchers seeking to identify previously unrecognized targets for new drugs. The illustration is innovative for how it clearly organizes the complex characteristics of the TME using value, color, texture, depth and relative position. A circular composition was created around a cluster of active cancer cells allowing the eye to move easily between each unique feature. Clarity is further established by grouping similar elements such as characteristics of the desmoplasia, response of adaptive immune cells, and drugs and their targets. The contrast ratio of the text was calibrated to improve legibility for the visually impaired.",

To facilitate understanding and collaboration amongst the various stakeholders, from researchers to the public, it was important to create an image for PowerPoint presentations that described the overarching themes of the research, the basic science and the models and tools used. To highlight the centrality of interstitial pneumonia in severe respiratory disease, normal vs diseased alveoli are featured prominently in the image. The conventional representation of alveoli is as a simple 2D schematic. While this may be useful for illustrating the basic mechanism of gas exchange, it is insufficient for showing how fluid buildup happens or where inflammatory cells are coming from. Thus the decision to represent each alveolus as a highly rendered 3D structure allows for a much more intuitive view of viral pneumonia and its contributing factors. Nipah virus has been limited to Southeast Asia, but 1918 Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are globally distributed. Thus, it became important to include a human host that was suitably representative of the Southeast Asian population but also universal enough in appearance to not limit the scope of the problem to a specific geographic area. As a teaching tool, particularly as it pertains to SARS-CoV-2, it is hoped that this image can facilitate public discussion and foster further research into one of the most prescient issues affecting the global community.",

LDM is the most common congenital anomaly of the knee and is evaluated based on four features: meniscal width, meniscal height, peripheral stability, and meniscus tear (presence, location, type). Classification of LDM is difficult because of the wide spectrum and heterogeneity of its pathomorphology. In an effort to develop a reliable classification system for LDM, a group of pediatric orthopaedic surgeons from 20 academic North American institutions reviewed existing systems and developed a novel system. It is the first LDM classification system to be proposed and evaluated for reliability. This figure plays a vital role in representing the group's novel research in an organized, visual manner to help standardize descriptions of LDM pathology to facilitate research, guide treatment, and improve outcomes of patient care.",

A hilar twist is completed when the pulmonary ligament is released allowing the lung to be rotated 180-° on the hilar axis. As the lung is rotated, the hilar vessels fully compress against the bronchus providing rapid hemorrhage control of the pulmonary vessels.This illustration is a figure in the textbook for the Advanced Trauma Operative Management (ATOM) course. The ATOM course is intended for surgeons who do not often encounter penetrating trauma. The illustration depicts a right lung with a completed hilar twist that highlights compression of the hilar vessels. For teaching purposes, the rotated lung and surrounding anatomy are depicted without deformity. Initial drafts included tissue deformities that occur during this procedure distracted viewers from the learning objectives. To provide further visual clarity, the right and left lung surfaces are semi-transparent so internal structures may be viewed.

The new experimental method allows immediate observation of the effects of protein depletion, allowing them to discover this crucial checkpoint before elongation starts. Proving that RPB1 (RNAPII's largest subunit) degradation occurs during early elongation (shown in step 5) through VCP inhibition allows better understanding of how this elongation checkpoint functions. 2D illustrations are used to supplement and provide background information in a simple manner for steps 3 and 5.

By providing a thorough anatomical context from multiple views, this illustration series aims to communicate the proper, safe technique for ESP block administration to a larger audience of anesthesiologists to treat a broader patient population. A bright blue color was used to contrast the medication with the surrounding muscle.  As the illustrations show, the medication enters a plane directly above the transverse process, lifting the erector spinae muscles away from the bone.  The -¾ view of the thoracic region is used to give the operator a three-dimensional understanding in context with the spinal nerves. Sagittal and transverse sections were drawn to show that the depth of the transverse processes varies with the vertebral layer. The insets demonstrate that the L3 level is deeper than the T5 level.

In CS due to acute myocardial infarction, occlusion of the affected coronary artery results in myocardial ischemia and the heart's ventricular function decreases due to less contractile mass. Related decreased cardiac output and hypoperfusion is perceived by baroreceptors, causing sympathetic and neurohormonal constrictive reflexes. The RAAS cascade then increases salt and water retention, all of which cause volume overload and blood backup in the heart, yielding pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, and worsening ischemia. Systemic inflammatory response and end-organ dysfunction result from and contribute to the larger spiral. Events best targeted by interventions are marked by white text on purple headings. This figure cohesively combines gross and cellular pathology in a schematic format using original composition and hierarchy of arrows, information, and imagery to portray CS pathophysiology as a cyclical interplay of events and interactions. For those with vision impairments, contrast, line weight, and size are used such that text and arrow hierarchy do not rely on color.

    intended_purpose: "Bronchoscopy is a commonly performed diagnostic and therapeutic procedure, but it can be a frightening prospect for patients. Using this aid, patients can learn about bronchoscopy, understand its purpose, and visualize their own experience with this procedure before it takes place. The illustration proceeds from left to right through the respiratory tract in the path of the scope. While the patient typically lies down for the procedure, the image shows the patient in a vertical position, in order to show both a lateral and anterior view that share labels, making the most use of the space provided. Anatomical labels are used in the illustration and explained within the text using lay terms to help the patient become familiar with terminology their clinician likely will use. Some anatomy, such as the pharynx, esophagus, and bronchioles, has been simplified or omitted. The purpose of this is to improve comprehension and to provide patients with only the necessary information at this point of care. This resource was made for both print and digital viewing.

    medium_software: "Adobe Photoshop, pencil",
    presentation_format: "Print",
    primaryAudience: "Resident and attending neurosurgeons, medical students",
    intended_purpose: "The proximity of brainstem cavernous malformations (BSCMs) to tracts and cranial nerve nuclei makes it costly to disrupt normal tissue adjacent to the lesion in the separation plane. This interplay between tissue sensitivity and extreme eloquence makes it difficult to avoid leaving a remnant. Recurrences require operative intervention, which may increase morbidity, lengthen recovery, and add to overall costs. It is essential that neurosurgeons understand factors that lead to decreased visualization and \"blind spots\" which can conceal remnants, such as small keyhole surgical openings, long corridors which can limit viewing angles, and sharp right-angles in the lesion beds. This illustration works to illuminate the anatomy of the blind spot by depicting an impossible view of the neurosurgical corridor and emphasizing how limited the visibility within the resection cavity can be. By understanding the anatomy of the blind spot and implementing a right-angle method of resection, fewer vestigial cavernomas will be left in patients, leading to quicker recoveries, less recurring lesions, and better quality of life.",

Although BSCMs are highly variable in size, shape, and position, they are naturally categorized by location into three types: midbrain, pons, and medulla. Further categorization into subtypes within these regions forms the basis of this new taxonomy. These illustrations provide a comprehensive visual overview of a selected subtype from each region. The top panel features a simplified circuit diagram and cut sections showing the tracts and nuclei affected by the lesion. The patient illustration and accompanying figures bring to life the resulting named syndromes and selected associated symptoms. The bottom panel describes surgical approach considerations including the craniotomy, surgical window, and resulting exposure. Insets along the bottom show \"augmented views,\" which highlight critical anatomy, anatomical triangles, and deep nuclei in the area. BSCMs are associated with recognizable constellations of neurologic symptoms. Consideration of diversity in ethnicity, age, gender, and body type was top of mind when selecting and illustrating representative \"patients\" to convey these symptoms, both to increase the presence of underrepresented groups in medical literature and to underscore the wide range of individuals affected by these rare lesions.",

In this surgery, the bladder and other organs are removed and the autonomic nerves of the pelvic visceral plexus that supply erectile tissue and the external urethral sphincter are spared to preserve sexual function and continence. Historically, this procedure has been recommended for male patients. Now, more surgeons are attempting to bring NS techniques to female patients. The purpose of these illustrations is to provide detailed anatomy of the plexuses showing pathways of autonomic innervation from the SHP to the cavernous nerves and structures being innervated. The layout compares male and female anatomy, showing analogous structures and critical differences surgeons must understand as they perform NS more widely. Inclusion of the pudendal nerve and its branches shows overlapping somatic innervation. Because these nerves cannot be seen in the surgical field, surgeons must be confident in this anatomy.  These illustrations—informed by several recent papers, cadaveric dissections, 3D modeled CT data, and review by expert surgeons—will be published in a urologic atlas to educate surgeons on techniques, procedures, and surgical anatomy. Although male pelvic plexus anatomy is better studied and understood, the exact course of these nerves in male and female patients is yet to be confirmed. Giving surgeons this visual comparison is crucial for successful outcomes for all patients as NS technique is expanded.",

It was designed for kidney care specialists at all levels. The challenge was to create an immersive, atmospheric and dramatic window into the environment of the kidney glomeruli. The illustration incorporates a dramatic magnified view of one of the glomeruli to clearly show the spherical cluster of convoluted, looping capillaries, which form the core of a glomerulus. These capillaries are covered by an interdigitating layer of podocyte cells. The entire spherical mass is enclosed within the Bowman's capsule. Waste derived from the blood stream is excreted from the capillaries, passes through filtration slits between the podocyte 'fingers' and into the glomerular space within the capsule. The urine droplets then coalesce and leave the glomerulus via the proximal tubule.Knowing about the normal, healthy glomerulus is foundational to an understanding of glomerular disease conditions. According to the National Kidney Foundation, ~15% of adults in the US have kidney disease, most commonly diabetic nephropathy. African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians and other minority groups are at higher risk of glomerular disease due to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Women are also at slightly higher risk than men. Unfortunately, 2 out of  5 people with kidney disease are unaware that they have a problem.",

The illustration is novel for the way it places the heart and COVID virion in a new context. A heart is shown uncomfortably shackled to a greatly oversized COVID virion by a large heavy chain. Strong cast shadows and exaggerated proportions help communicate the weight of the ball and chain. The distressed texture of the metal contrasts with the supple and resilient heart tissue which reacts uncomfortably to the tightness of the shackle. Injury to the heart is implied by the grasp of the shackle and a red inflammatory-like glow. In the background are two electrocardiograms pasted to a brick wall. The right ECG shows signals diagnostic of a dysrhythmia. Wear and tear of the paper provides an additional yet subtle implication of the effects of long COVID.",

    intended_purpose: "In November of 2021 Dr Tiago Donatelli Serafim and a team of researchers from NIH published the most comprehensive review of leishmaniasis to date, fulfilling a pressing and unmet need by placing a spotlight on a disease that primarily affects low-income populations. Worldwide, leishmaniasis affects as many as 12 million people with 1.5 to 2.0 million new cases reported annually. Classified as a neglected tropical disease, leishmaniasis is part of a diverse group of tropical infections that are chronically underrepresented in biomedical research. When a female sand fly is infected with Leishmania, the bite results in egestion of a concoction of molecules and parasites that play varied and critical roles in promoting disease establishment. The central focus of this cover image is the inoculum, color coded to distinguish between the individual components. A vibrant and predominantly red color palette is intended to immediately draw the viewer in by evoking the dynamism of the immune response and the inherent danger posed by the Leishmania parasite. Leishmania promastigotes are depicted in green amidst a soluble green cloud of promastigote secretory gel, and a yellow cloud of saliva interspersed with purple microbiota and yellow exosomes. Later, neutrophils are recruited to the bite site depicted here in a struggle with an invading promastigote. Extravascular leakage of red blood cells also occurs, thought to play a role in controlling inflammation.",

These illustrations are utilized in the Combat Orthopedic Trauma Surgery course materials. This course sets combat training competencies and training standards for military medical providers caring for those in harm's way.A groin flap is a reliable limb-saving procedure when there is extensive soft tissue damage to the hand or wrist. The illustrations provide visual clarity beyond what accompanying course case photos show. The first identifies pertinent anatomical landmarks and structures that must be preserved to ensure flap success and maintain health of the donor site. The second demonstrates the careful dissection of the plane between the sartorius muscle and its superficial fascia. This frees the flap and preserves the superficial circumflex iliac artery and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Finally, the hand is transposed to the donor site where the flap is sutured around the defect and the donor site is closed. The point of view (POV) for this series is slightly oblique to the surgeons. It is important to orient viewers as this POV also corresponds with course case photos. Underlying anatomical structures are ghosted under the skin in the anterior view inset and the primary oblique view. This POV provides an ideal view of the sartorius muscle fascia dissection plane and its preserved neurovasculature that is critical for a successful groin flap.",

The nanoparticles deliver mRNA to T cells, reprogramming them in vivo to transiently express chimeric antigen receptors (gold) that target pathogenic cardiac fibroblasts. Lipid nanoparticles are initially injected into the circulatory system, so a post injection blood vessel was set to be the scene. I decided that it would be best to focus on the interaction and interface between the lipid nanoparticles and a targeted T cell's membrane vs adding yet another element of much larger scale that screamed \"cardiac\". Juxtaposing many elements of varying sizes and scales within a single piece can be overwhelming, both visually and contextually.

The river's curve ties this introduction to the method of invasion at the anatomical and cellular levels. The amoeba's path of travel and associated text boxes lead through the mechanisms of entry and destruction. Much research has been done to figure out these mechanisms. This image compiles it in an attractive visual summary. It helps educate doctors so they may consider primary amoebic meningoencephalitis a possibility if a patient presents with meningitis-like symptoms following recent exposure to warm water. It also shows researchers what is known about the infection and encourages them to see if more can be learned. The overall dark tone of the background creates an ominous feel to represent the scary idea of a tiny organism eating your brain. This contrasts with the pretty aqua color of the amoeba itself, representing how it is just an organism trying to live that happily takes advantage of an opportunity for food. All text and labels have at least a 7:1 contrast ratio and visual elements were examined in black and white. A young male is depicted as they make up the majority of cases.

He also went on to become a pioneer in sickle cell anemia research, treatment, and advocacy.Color and light were used to create subtle distinctions between the different time periods. Facial expressions, body language, and creative use of perspective were essential to help connect the reader to the gamut of emotions Dr. Blanchard felt during her time as a medical student—from moments of hope and excitement to times of frustration when she felt the weight of racial disparity. For added context, a panel of data demonstrates that despite positive change, racial disparity is still a major challenge in the medical field.

Placing mice in darkness prior to tumor onset to decrease visual experience and reduce optic nerve activity prevents the tumors entirely, despite the genetic predisposition.

Quality control of gene expression provides balance to the cell. For example, messenger RNA translation and stability are intertwined as described by Bae and Coller. Messenger RNA (mRNA) translation by the ribosome represents the final step of a complicated molecular dance from DNA to protein. Although classically considered a decipherer that translates a 64-word genetic code into a proteome of astonishing complexity, the ribosome can also shape the transcriptome by controlling mRNA stability. An artistic representation of the interconnectivity between gene expression events is depicted in mandala form. \"Mandala\" is Sanskrit for \"circle\" and is thought to be a visual metaphor for stability, symmetry, and balance.

The composition and shimmering effects work to that end. The color palette was chosen to give the feel of being inside a computer network. This is also helped by the dark background with subtle gridlines reminiscent of 3D computer graphics. The lighting strikes a balance between a technological feel and real-world light.

Since these papers were all about contributing data, I reasoned that a data visualization would be an appropriate way to showcase their work as a whole. The researchers provided a linear visualization of each chromosome with newly added regions highlighted. I made thoughtful use of Illustrator tools to draw each chromosome into shapes while keeping their relative proportions accurate. High contrast denotes the new sequences (red) from the rest (white) to ensure the somewhat small amount of new sequences did not get lost. The background tone is close to white and tinted toward red. To further emphasize the work of the consortium, I drew the chromosomes into arcs so the eye is lead from end to end, or telomere to telomere. Each chromosome begins at bottom right and reads from outside in X, 1-22. Though the sex chromosomes are typically shown after chromosome 22, here chromosome X is in front of 1 (chromosome Y was not included in the dataset) for design purposes due to its lengthiness.

The client requested a visual summary exhibit that identified the major injuries and would serve as a springboard for the additional 15 anatomical and surgical trial exhibits depicting the specific injuries and treatment. The difficulty in presentation lay in the fact that many injuries needed to be depicted from multiple view points (anterior, posterior) and could best be depicted with diagnostic imaging.",

    primaryAudience: "Jury",
    intended_purpose: "The plaintiff presented to the dentist multiple times over several years after root canal surgery complaining of pain on the lateral aspect of his tongue. His dentist passed his complaints off initially as related to his root canal, then to biting his tongue, then to a small ulcer before ultimately sending him for an MRI. The MRI revealed extensive squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue extending across the midline of the tongue. The extensive cancer required a near total glossectomy which left him with a non-functional tongue and no sense of taste. The first exhibit shows how the tongue appeared and the extent of cancer when the dentist finally took action to address the plaintiff's symptoms. The next two exhibits broadly depict the surgery to remove the cancer to allow the surgeon to summarize what is done in a near total glossectomy. It identifies the soft tissue removed in the neck dissection, the extent of the floor of the mouth resected, the extent of tongue removed and the reconstruction with donor skin graft. The last exhibit contrasts  a near-total resection with a hemiglossectomy which would've resulted in a better result had the cancer been detected earlier.",

    intended_purpose: "The purpose of the illustration is to provide surgeons with a visual convention to determine the origin of the coronary arteries in congenitally corrected transposition of the Great Arteries (ccTGA). With ccTGA, the usage of \"left\" and \"right\" can be confusing for anatomic sidedness versus intrinsic morphologic nature.For the most common coronary pattern in ccTGA with a leftward/anterior aorta, sinus #1 (right-hand sinus), which is anatomically the leftward and posterior sinus, gives origin to the right coronary artery; and sinus #2 (left-hand sinus), which is rightward and anterior, gives origin to the main stem of the left coronary artery. The anatomic right-sided coronary artery is therefore a morphologic left coronary artery, with a short main stem dividing into the anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries. The anatomic left-sided coronary artery is therefore a morphologic right coronary artery. By depicting the surgeon standing within the non-adjacent aortic sinus with a view toward the pulmonary trunk, the surgeon observes the morphologic right coronary artery arising on his right-hand side; and the morphologic left coronary artery arising on his left-hand side.The overhead orientation also provides visualization of the abnormal connection of the great arteries — with the aorta originating from the morphologic right ventricle (mRV), and the pulmonary artery from the morphologic left ventricle (mLV).

The anatomical information on the left page as well as the illustrated anatomy within the stretch photo enhances the knowledge and awareness of each muscle's role and range of motion. After completing the entire book, every major muscle will be addressed. Videos were recorded alongside the photography in an effort to utilize QR code technology to include a 30 second example of each stretch. This book was launched domestically as well as internationally in Asia. The QR addition is a great way to introduce proper technique to someone whose primary language is not English. Additionally, watching a video at home is helpful for clients that are not working with a physical therapist in person, such as COVID-related remote fitness programs. The video will give the patient confidence to perform the stretch at home without fear of injury.",

OCD of the capitellum is most commonly seen in young athletes from overuse of the elbow. For developing adolescents, OATS is an increasingly popular method of preserving articular congruity and joint stability because it replaces diseased tissue of the capitellum with healthy tissue from a donor site (lateral femoral condyle). In the operating room, the procedure is extremely difficult to observe or capture with a camera as the opening incision is very small. The 3D surgical models were created to be particularly helpful for use in teaching presentations for orthopedic residents and surgeons. The animation has been used in conjunction with surgical footage to enhance teaching and learning of operative techniques for treating OCD in young athletes. This animation is an edited portion of a longer teaching video to be published online along with surgical video footage and recorded narration. For the purposes of this submission, additional text was added to replace the voice recording and the video highlights the three major portions of OATS: recipient site preparation, donor grafting, and graft placement.",

This animation was designed to be viewed in stereoscopic format and without any music or voiceover as it is to be used in presentations with a speaker. The Sylvian fissure is formed from the relationship of the frontoparietal and temporal operculum. It is frequently used as a microneurosurgical corridor due to its low anatomical variance and accessibility as a pathway into the deep anatomical areas of the brain. The viewer is oriented in the surgical view. The superficial Sylvian veins are resting atop the lateral Sylvian membrane which is stretched for educational viewing of the fissure. Within the fissure, the M4 branches become M3 branches that course both sides of the fissure and pierce through the intermediate Sylvian membrane. Continuing deeper, the viewer is taken across the surface of the insula moving towards the front of the head. The medial Sylvian membrane is visible on the left and separates the M3 to M2 branch loops. We then follow the M2 branches on the insular surface, to become the M1 and end at the proximal Sylvian membrane that divides the Sylvian and carotid cisterns. By demonstrating the arachnoid membranes with brain and vascular anatomy in a 3-dimensional animation, neurosurgeons may better understand these unique anatomical micro-relationships, which may aid in neurosurgical technique.",

The stories of four monoclonal antibodies are shown to illustrate the three actions.  The 3D models for each are a hybrid of atomic structure and abstracted \"lock and key\" antibody design.  This design approach gives a concrete demonstration of how each antibody fits to the target while also showing the reality of its lively flexibility.

The video explains terms the patient is likely to hear -vertabrae, foramina, microdiscectomy and more- using simple terms and analogies and clear accompanying visuals so that patients can readily understand the problem at hand and how the discectomy aims to remedy the issue. And despite the need to include some complex terms the patient is likely to hear, the piece still comes in at a 7th grade reading level. The video uses clear, simple visuals to draw the viewer's attention to the area of focus, whether it be an explanation of a pinched nerve or how the disc material is to be removed. We intentionally avoid showing the breaking of the skin barrier, the grinding of bone and other elements that user testing told us would be off-putting to patients and instead opted for cross-fades and depictions that omitted imagery that could scare or intimidate lay viewers.

Traditionally, the study of biological creatures has often required the observation of specimens that are taken from nature. To avoid the removal of live specimens, this animation allows students to learn about anatomy and the process of reproduction without having to disturb or remove animals from their natural habitat. The focus of this animation centers on the unique process of seahorse reproduction. A mating pair of Lined Seahorse's (Hippocampus erectus) were created to be as realistic as possible, just as they are seen on Caribbean reefs local to the area. The colors of the environment and seahorses are intentionally muted to give an accurate depiction of light absorption at the depth they inhabit. Seahorses are an excellent example of non-traditional gender roles, with the males being one of the only animals in existence to give birth to offspring. Following this theme, the traditional color scheme used to denote male and female, blue and pink, was avoided. Instead, the female is highlighted as blue, and the male highlighted as orange, which were picked due to being complementary and contrasting well with one another.",

    primaryAudience: "Medical students",
    intended_purpose: "Created for an audience of medical students, the primary purpose of this animation is to provide a distilled explanation of immunoglobulin class switching, an irreversible process in the body's humoral immune response that allows B cells to produce antibodies of different isotypes in response to invading pathogens or foreign substances. The generation of new isotypes occurs through recombination of the antibody's heavy chain constant region gene, resulting in a change from IgM and IgD expression to IgG, IgE, or IgA. The switched isotype is determined by exposure to specific cytokines secreted by T helper (CD4+) cells -- a key concept that medical students are often tested on and that have important pharmacological applications. Though it is a broad overview of the topic, the concepts covered in this animation provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases, reactions, and/or health conditions that may arise from defects in certain steps in this process, resulting in impaired production of the switched isotype. Additionally, the recent integration of animation into UWorld's learning platform offers dynamic visualizations to help medical students summarize complex sequences of events and serves as a supplemental, educational resource referenced in a practice question bank for students preparing to take USMLE Step 1 and COMLEX.",

We used a recurring Venn diagram motif throughout the piece to reinforce the unique dual role of CDK7 in cell cycle progression and transcription. Since CDK7 mediates its dual function through large, multi-protein complexes, we used multiple data to build and animate these complexes, including the 50-subunit RNAPII pre-initiation complex. Using motion graphics and contrasting cool and warm color palettes, we established a visual language to easily differentiate between the normal and malignant activities of CDK7.",

AXS approached this animation as we would any data-driven mechanism of action video, but with light as the therapeutic. Based on published peer-reviewed findings, our 3D artists and content experts determined how specific wavelengths of PBM light stimulate metabolic pathways. The animation follows PBM light as it enters the eye, illuminating the viewer's journey through the structures and cells. Within photoreceptors, PBM light activates the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) pathway, directly stimulating the production of mitochondrial energy in dysfunctional retinal cells.",

The 3D interactive provides a unique way for clinicians to visualize, interact with, and explore the progression of this disease in response to varied treatments (or lack thereof) and to discuss it with their students.  They can also use this tool to show patients the dire consequences of failure to comply with complete treatment regimens.  Due to the cost and length of tuberculosis treatment, this failure to comply is a primary reason this curable and preventable disease killed 1.5 million people in 2020. Finally, in certain cases, alongside researchers, we are able to demonstrate features that might impact guidelines used by global institutions like the WHO which dictate how/when a patient is diagnosed or cured of the disease.  The 3D models were segmented directly from CT data using 3D Slicer, then optimized using ZBrush.  The web-based application was built using Babylon.js.

NASH can lead to permanent scarring and hardening (cirrhosis), and increased risk of liver transplant, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Risk factors include obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension. Obesity in the U.S. has doubled in the last decade alongside a steady rise in fatty liver disease – a silent disease - though patients may start to show signs when it has progressed to NASH. NASH may be reversible with lifestyle changes and clinical trials are also in development.This model showcases the progression of fatty liver to NASH, cirrhosis, and HCC in a series of slices for use in the recruitment of clinical trial candidates for a drug in development to treat NASH. Each liver slice represents a stage, with progression moving left (normal) to right (HCC). The slices include visual and tactile changes that reflect the stage. The fatty liver slice is enlarged and soft, then slices become firmer to represent increased inflammation and fibrosis. Nodules are embedded in the cirrhotic slice. During consultations, the model not only shows progression, but can also be used to demonstrate that damage may be reversible at the NASH slice with treatment. The model provides tangible support to the conversation, with the goal of setting the patient on the right track to improve their health, quality of life, and reduce disease burden.",

    intended_purpose: "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an extremely rare and debilitating genetic disease. It can be difficult for physicians to recognize early signs and symptoms, despite a few easily identifiable features. FOP is characterized by a pattern of soft tissue inflammation followed by formation of heterotopic bone. Before ossification occurs, flareups may be mistaken for other conditions (eg, tumors), which can lead to unnecessary testing. Biopsies, as well as intramuscular injections and surgery, can provoke additional flareups/ossification and must be avoided. Early diagnosis is paramount to limiting iatrogenic harm. This model was created to educate healthcare providers (HCPs) so that they may be able to identify FOP patients sooner. The spine, ribcage and intercostal muscles were chosen because the upper back is a common site of soft tissue swellings and later in life, many patients suffer from complications of thoracic insufficiency syndrome as a result of heterotopic bone buildup. Subcutaneous tissue is included for the flareup stage, enabling HCPs to palpate the skin and feel a representation of inflammatory swellings. When the top half is removed, muscle degradation with angiogenesis can be seen. The accompanying booklet provides important information about the pathophysiology, disease progression and key clinical considerations. Pharmaceutical reps are traveling around with these kits and bringing them into offices to educate HCPs and promote awareness of FOP.",

The plastic, clear head has a built-in case for protection, and a tilt feature to allow the head to be placed at 45 degrees, to demonstrate the correct head tilt for administration. The nasal cavity is big enough to accept the tip of the nasal spray for demonstration purposes. Due to production in the middle of the pandemic, the entire production run was completed domestically to avoid material shortages, factory shutdowns, oversea shipping delays and exponential shipping costs. We utilized a combination of 3D printing and tradition production techniques to produce a durable, quality product. We hope the successful run of this model will encourage more companies to consider custom model development using local resources and manufacturing practices.

Using several racially diverse patients’ CT scans for reference, skin, nasal cartilage, and bone were sculpted in Blender. Molds were created in Blender and printed to create an easily reproducible means to cast the component of the model representing skin. Ecoflex 00-30 silicone was selected for skin component, and models were created to represent a variety of skin tones using Silc-Pig pigment. A reusable base incorporating nasal cartilage and bone was printed. This workflow will provide a safe, cost-effective, and still three dimensional means of attaining proficiency in Mohs reconstruction.Plastic and reconstructive surgery residents at Brown University practiced reconstruction on the model and were given an assessment and survey to evaluate teaching efficacy of the simulation tool.

Damage to this nerve negatively impacts the cochlea and semicircular canals, resulting in hearing loss and balance issues. NF is a source of disability for pediatric and adult patients around the world. While tumors are commonly associated with cancer in the minds of physicians and patients, it is important to consider that benign tumors are also responsible for debilitating damage to the human body. Because NF is autosomal dominant, it persists regardless of its rarity. Physicians should be aware of this presentation of NF when addressing hearing and balance problems in their patients, especially in lower-income areas where access genetic testing is hard to procure. NF does not improve on its own, and receiving accurate treatment relies on the physicians' ability to recognize the symptoms and presentation.",

Regardless of the vaccine, it remains essential to create educational tools about the pathological nature of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, because many at-risk areas may not have access to the vaccine, or may experience vaccine hesitancy due to cultural implications.  The purpose of this illustration is to highlight the pathologic agent of malaria– the Plasmodium parasite. This illustration features two levels of call-outs, the first of which explains that the parasites infect red blood cells, and the second of which shows the life-cycle of the parasite. It is essential to understand both of these pieces of information in order to diagnose malaria through microscopy. The portrait of a young child was chosen to represent a malaria patient, because most deaths from malaria occur in patients under five years of age. The illustration is intended to be presented to medical students and healthcare professionals when learning about malaria.",

The Testes Descent diagram in the upper left corner summarizes the path of the testes, with both it and the spermatic cord illustration at a ¾ orientation to provide an unobscured view of the testes upon its descent. The central illustration summarizes the layers of the abdominal wall and spermatic cord in the inguinal area. Cord layers are thicker than their actual anatomical proportions for improved visibility. Trans-inguinal Phase diagrams on the right further explain testes descent as it leads to spermatic cord layer formation; the phase diagrams lead the reader's eye to the resulting spermatic cord image to reinforce this relationship. Both the Spermatic Cord Contents and Trans-inguinal Phase diagrams color-code corresponding transitional layers to establish their association. For accessibility consideration, the color-code palette is limited to four colors, which are arranged so that similar values and hues are non-adjacent when viewed with red-green colorblindness filters. Moreover, spermatic cord layer labels include a description of part of the abdominal wall it originated from, providing an alternative way to identify what component is contributing to the cord without solely relying on color.",

These illustrations are intended to educate college students while staying true to the anatomy observed in cadaver laboratories. Many medical illustrations in dissection manuals show idealized anatomy, and are inaccurate to how human specimens are seen in a laboratory setting. Dissection guides often leave out explanations on dissection techniques, making the learning process for students without prior dissection knowledge extremely difficult. To combat these issues, I developed the featured illustrations directly from my own observational sketches of cadavers. Through digital painting methods, I was able to achieve realistic renderings of cadavers and pair them with clear text descriptions of dissection techniques to aid in student understanding of the anatomy of the back.",

    intended_purpose: "This illustration of the lumbosacral plexus was designed for first year medical students completing human anatomy dissections for the first time. Previous depictions of the lumbosacral plexus are almost entirely from an anterior view. The choice to depict an anterior oblique view reflected the angle that student dissections typically take place. By replicating this view, my goal was to improve student comprehension when preparing for dissection and reviewing for exams. I included the psoas major and iliacus muscles on one side as they are commonly encountered during dissection but obscure much of the plexus. An anterior oblique view also presented an opportunity to divide the lumbar and sacral plexuses for further clarity, and show their spatial relationship. My choice to depict both a didactic and schematic version was also done with first year medical students in mind. When first introduced to the region, students must memorize the vertebral origins of each nerve. In the didactic view, the overlapping nerves make it difficult to trace each nerve to its vertebral origin. By including a simplified schematic, my goal was to expedite this process. Finally, the number of colors in the schematic provided a challenge for visual accessibility , however, colors were rigorously adjusted to contrast in value and be accessible to all viewers.",

The illustrations of the steps, accompanying text, skeletons and additional information in the exercise sections were designed to include more information than most similar handouts, such as those from a physical therapist, so that the patient can confidently and correctly perform them without supervision and direction from a professional. For the rendering and additional elements, I worked within the constraints of a pediatric audience and anticipated these pages being printed in black and white and being photocopied multiple times. Because of that the exercises are in black line and the anatomy on the first page is in simple color that translates into grayscale without losing visual information. While the purpose of the pages was to be specifically designed for and used by pediatric patients they can be used by anyone as an at home exercise program.",

The aneurysm sac is then reapproximated, encasing the graft. Two suture patterns are depicted: interrupted and running. The central main image shows how the needle enters and exits the vessel wall, the tying of the interrupted sutures, and the finished appearance. A bright spotlight directs the viewer's attention to the aneurysm sac. Surrounding anatomy is dimmed and blurred to eliminate distraction. At both ends of the aneurysm sac, running sutures anastomose the graft to healthy arterial tissue. Further details are shown in the 2 insets: inset A depicts the beginning (back of the vessel wall) and inset B the completion (front wall) of the running pattern, performed using a double-armed needle. Celiac trunk and splenic artery are shown clamped during the suturing. Sutures are color-coded using a colorblind accessible palette.

Those who are eligible generally suffer from obesity-related health issues or exhibit BMIs of 40 and above, with little success from diet and exercise. Poor health outcomes associated with obesity have taken on a new urgency in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the popularity of (traditionally underutilized) bariatric procedures has increased. This increased demand should be met with a supply of capable, well-educated surgeons. Poor education and subpar outcomes may exacerbate cultural stigmas around surgery as an \"easy way out\" treatment for obesity. Compounding the need for better instruction is the complexity of the gastric bypass procedure as well as the development of new technologies, ie. robotic assistance.This surgical series assists residents and surgeons in training with an advanced, contemporary guide for the procedure. A ''laparoscopic view'' incorporates current robotic tools and aims to detail accurate internal views of the abdominal cavity - with relevant viscera. Since the gastrointestinal system can be spatially challenging, these views are paired with simplified line drawings that feature didactic aids or classic anterior views of anatomy. Frustrated students can rely on legible captions (dark on white backgrounds) and schematics that highlight the action of a given surgical step.",

I first tried out different angles with the 3D volume rendering model made from CT images of an example patient. I ended up with the angle that best demonstrated how the probe was tilted caudally (for ITG) and vertically (for cervical goiters). The morphology of the thyroid gland also adhered to the appearance of the example patient, in which the left lobe appeared relatively normal in size, as clinical images would be placed right next to my illustration. The client was happy with how the probe and RFA needle were placed relatively to each other, as I also performed in-plane echo-guided navigation during clinical practice.

    intended_purpose: "This figure illustrates the structural differences between PTEN in its active and inactive states in a cellular landscape. PTEN is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) phospholipid phosphatase that typically dephosphorylates PIP3 into PIP2. However, it is often silenced or mutated in cancer cells. PTEN structure consists of a catalytic domain, C2 domain, and C-terminal tail. When catalytically active, the C2 domain associates with the cell membrane and the C-terminal tail remains open for PIP3 to enter the active site. An inset shows the helix structure of PTEN's catalytic domain, where the position of the residues creates a positively charged surface. Once the C-terminal tail becomes phosphorylated at four key sites (S380, T382, T383, and S385), the tail closes on the active site and PTEN disassociates from the cell membrane. An N-terminal a-helix is crucial for PTEN catalysis but is disordered upon C-terminal tail interaction or when PTEN is in a closed state.",

SLISY is a novel method that uses sequencing to simultaneously assess the entire sequence diversity within a selected phage pool for identification of clones with high specificity. This method had never been visualized in the past. In step 1, a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) phage library is negatively selected against the MERS spike protein, followed by rounds of positive selection against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein depicted in step 2. In step 3, the complementarity-determining region H3 (CDRH3) region of the scFv is sequenced; a SLISY ratio is determined for each clone, representing the specificity to SARS-CoV-2. The entire scFv region of highly specific clones are sequenced in step 4. The gene block is then cloned into phagemid vectors to express monoclonal scFv, as shown in step 5. Finally, in step 6, monoclonal antibodies are generated for a validation study. In this illustration, arrows were used to help guiding viewers through the flow of the story. Simplified, repetitive elements were used to highlight the core action in each step, which provides an easy-to-follow visualization of this complex method involving multiple scales.",

While previous attempts at locating these cells in humans were unfruitful, a recent study succeeded in both localizing these specialized neurons and elucidating the mechanism by which they track the progression of time. This editorial cover was inspired by the corresponding publication and was designed with the purpose of generating intrigue on the topic. The target audience of this piece is an educated general public who would see the image on the cover of a popular scientific magazine. This 3D piece employs a simple visual metaphor for time through the use of an hourglass shape for the constructed network of interconnected neurons. Continuing with the hourglass analogy, a glass-like material was chosen for the neurons. The nerve impulses between the neurons and cell nuclei were represented as lights and used to provide internal lighting to the model while drawing visual attention. Altogether, the chosen design elements of the composition serve to indicate the important role that hippocampal neurons play in our perception of time.",

These traps are vacuum-driven and are widely considered the most sophisticated trapping mechanism in the plant kingdom... as well as the fastest, producing recorded accelerations of several hundred g forces. Even with high-speed camera playback slowed down 100x, the trap's firing mechanism is faster than the human eye can process. Photography of this plant is limited by the tiny scale of its bladders and its natural tendency to form mats, so all available media are shot under a microscope. This animation provides an *in situ* look at this fascinating plant. The narration and camera work are meant to invoke the style of popular nature documentaries that a lay audience would be familiar with. Moreover, its light script avoids getting bogged down in minutiae, and its timing is designed to let viewers digest information with care.

In particular, the heart often represents a target organ and patients may develop heart failure. Since 2019, the scientific community has made significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The purpose of this animation is to address some of these complex processes with an intent to recognize that individual processes may be susceptible to pharmacological interference and future therapeutic strategies to combat infectivity. This animation is part of an interactive learning module being used by Augusta University Health to teach cardiologists how to diagnose and treat myocarditis. The user of this module will encounter this animation when discussing the viral entry phase of viral myocarditis. SARS-CoV-2 has shown to have a selection of two pathways to enter host cells, in which the mechanisms of inhibition of infectivity for each pathway can differ.

Immersive media is poised as a potent education tool to convey complex information in a visually and experientially engaging way, further supported by increasing accessibility of the medium through affordable headsets and utilization in public education spaces. The novelty of the media presents particular visualization challenges compared to traditional media (i.e. planar animations), including motion sickness and losing audience attention to low-priority elements/action. To address issues of motion sickness, the viewer is statically placed in a nerve synapse. Each view presents a particular facet of neurotransmission with guiding text call-outs that are animated to reinforce visual concepts, addressing issues of misdirected attention while giving visual space to simplify complex concepts into discrete representations.

Content scaffolding was designed to progress the user through logical steps; text and images were tailored toward a general audience. It encourages users to engage with an online community of individuals with similar interests and motivates users to take what they learn on the site and practice it in the real world. Users have a social account, engage in game-like features, and are encouraged to connect with other foragers. Users test their knowledge and progress in this comprehensive tool through quizzes and light-hearted competition.",

    title: "M - 003_How Gravity Affects the Human Body",
    medium_software: "Procreate and Adobe Illustrator and Animate",
    presentation_format: "webpage",
    primaryAudience: "general lay audience",
    intended_purpose: "Gravity field changes in space have a great effect on the human body and it is important to consider these effects, and corresponding countermeasures when discussing space exploration. Despite immense interest in the universe, the general public is rarely aware of the risks that come with sending humans to space or the preventative measures developed to keep astronauts safe. This digital interactive will be located on NASA's Human Research Programs website and will help educate the general public and anyone interested in space exploration. The interactive uses simple illustrations, animations and text to lead the lay audience through the effects which occur to the human body due to microgravity as well as the countermeasures which have been developed to prevent and correct said effects. Overall, the resource will be used as an educational tool which is not only informative but is fascinating to explore and will get people interested about the future of human space exploration.",

    title: "M - 004_VR Virus Builder",
    medium_software: "Blender, Unity, and Adobe Suite",
    presentation_format: "Video",
    primaryAudience: "General audience",
    intended_purpose: "VR Virus Builder is an interactive immersive experience designed for a museum setting. Lay users are introduced to bacteriophage structure and function, tied to the primary game mechanic where users combine missing components (nucleocapsid, body, and/or tail) to partially completed viruses. Users must then \"load\" the completed bacteriophages into a cannon used to destroy a bacterial infection. This secondary game mechanic reinforces a secondary learning objective of the antibiotic potential of bacteriophages. Given the hesitancy towards novel, genetically engineered therapeutics, the social impact of this interactive is to create an engaging experience that effectively conveys otherwise unapproachable information about virus-derived therapeutics. Serving these learning objectives, a toon shader aesthetic was chosen to eliminate users' fixation on textural details. Glowing effects and halos were applied to different actions to direct audience interaction. An example can be seen when spawning a new, incomplete virus after loading the canon. Functionality as a whole was limited to grabbing and button pushes to promote quick engagement without adding a steep learning curve for new users. Additionally, large didactic panels are placed behind the user to display the lifecycle of a bacteriophage and the function of its various parts, reinforcing learning information conveyed through active participation.",

    title: "M - 005_Eunotosaurus: Rethinking Turtle Origins",
    medium_software: "Adobe XD",
    presentation_format: "MPEG 4",
    primaryAudience: "Post-Secondary Students, Graduate Students, Professors",
    intended_purpose: "How did turtles evolve? This question is as old as systematics itself. The Middle Permian reptile Eunotosaurus africanus, first described over a century ago but never modeled digitally until now, provides key insights into this age-old question. This interactive was developed to contextualize a novel reconstruction of the Eunotosaurus skull that I created for further study and outreach. It is meant to teach how this fossil informs the origin of the turtle body plan. It enables students and teachers to do two things: appreciate how fossils contribute to our understanding of modern species, and exercise basic evolutionary science skills like comparative morphological analysis, tree-thinking, and making educated inferences. These skills correspond with the three major sections of the application: Morphology, Phylogeny, and Resources. The didactic content for this application follows best practices for visualizing and teaching macroevolution. The phylogenetic tree, for example, is validated by primary literature on improving diagrammatic literacy in evolutionary science. The rotated branches visually disrupt erroneous preconceptions about the progression of evolution while the right angles visually reinforce divergence events at nodes. The text within avoids using design-oriented terms and makes crucial distinctions between \"crown\" and \"stem\" groups. An interactive medium was chosen for this work because it is ideal for teaching nuanced material while managing cognitive load.",
