      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <h1>Anonymity</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>An attempt will be made to keep the artists anonymous by covering the artistsâ€™ signatures on   printed work and asking that digital entries be submitted without credits for judging. (A credited   copy may be used for the Salon opening and display.)</li>
      <li>The identity of judges on individual scoring sheets will also remain anonymous.</li>
      <li>All work to be judged has an individual code number based on the category and item number.   This number must be entered at the top of each scoring sheet by the judge.</li>
